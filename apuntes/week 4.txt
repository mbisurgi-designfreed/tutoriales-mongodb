MONGO DB 101 with NodeJS

WEEK 4 - Schema Design

* MongoDB features
    - Rich documents
    - Pre joins / Embed data
    - No Mongo joins
    - No constraints
    - Atomic operations
    - No declared schema

* Relations in MongoDB
    - One to One
        + Two separate collections
        + Embed one document inside of the other one
    - One to Many
        + Embed one document inside of the other one
        + True Linking => Best approach
            - Two separate collections 
            - The collection that represents the many side of the relation will have a key to the collection that represents the one side of the relation
    - One to Few
        + Embed one document inside of the other one
    - Many to Many
        + Two separate collections
            - En each or one of the collections have an array of ids matching the ids on the other collection
            - Multikey Indexes
                + db.collection(collectionname).ensureIndex({ field: 1 })
    - Trees
