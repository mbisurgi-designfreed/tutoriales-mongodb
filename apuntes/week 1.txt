MONGO DB 101 with NodeJS

WEEK 1 - INTRODUCTION

* What is MongoDB
    It is a document database, that means that data is stored as JSON

* Structure of an app with MongoDB
    - Server
        + MongoDB => On the CLI or Terminal (Mac) run mongod command
            - Mongo Shell => CLI for interacting with MongoDB
    - Clients

* JSON
    JSON objects are formed by key - value pairs
        - Key
            + String
        - Value
            + String
            + Number
            + Boolean
            + Object => This involves nesting objects inside other objects
            + Array

* BSON
    BSON stands for Binary JSON. MongoDB drivers send and receive data as BSON, and data is stored on MongoDB as BSON
        - Lightweight
        - Traversable
        - Efficient
    
    BSON extends the value types provided by JSON
        - Value
            + Byte
            + Integer
            + Double
            + Date
            + Binary

* Mongo Shell
    - Starting Mongo => On the CLI or Terminal (Mac) run mongo command
    - Select a specific database => Once mongo is running run use [dbname] command
        + If database does not exist MongoDB will create it when inserting the first document
    - Select a specific collection => Once a database is selected run db.[collectionname] command
 
* CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    - Create => db.[collectionname].insertOne({ object })
        + Returns {'acknowledged': '', 'insertedId': ''}
            - Acknowledged => Command succeded (true - false)
            - InsertedId => Unique identifier, generated by MongoDB if we do not provide _id on the object passed as parameter
    - Read
        + db.[collectionname].find({}) => Returns all objects inside the specified collection as a Cursor
        + db.[collectionname].find({ object }) => Returns all objects inside the specified collection that has the condition of the object passed as parameter as a Cursor
        + Cursor
            - hasNext()
            - next()

* NodeJS driver
    Used for communicating with MongoDB using a NodeJS application
